        - SER_ID_ERR: Indicate that the PCC rule could not be successfully installed or enforced because the Service Identifier specified within the Charging Data policy decision which the PCC rule refers to is invalid, unknown, or not applicable to the service being charged.
        - NF_MAL: Indicate that the PCC rule could not be successfully installed (for those provisioned from the PCF) or activated (for those pre-defined in SMF) or enforced (for those already successfully installed) due to SMF/UPF malfunction.

        - MAX_NR_QoS_FLOW: Indicate that the PCC rule could not be successfully installed (for those provisioned from PCF) or activated (for those pre-defined in SMF) or enforced (for those already successfully installed) due to the fact that the maximum number of QoS flows has been reached for the PDU session.
        - MISS_FLOW_INFO: Indicate that the PCC rule could not be successfully installed or enforced because neither the "flowInfos" attribute nor the "appId" attribute is specified within the PccRule data structure by the PCF during the first install request of the PCC rule.

        - INCOR_FLOW_INFO: Indicate that the PCC rule could not be successfully installed or modified at the SMF because the provided flow information is not supported by the network (e.g. the provided IP address(es) or Ipv6 prefix(es) do not correspond to an IP version applicable for the PDU session).
        - PS_TO_CS_HAN: Indicate that the PCC rule could not be maintained because of PS to CS handover.

        - MISS_REDI_SER_ADDR: Indicate that the PCC rule could not be successfully installed or enforced at the SMF because there is no valid Redirect Server Address within the Traffic Control Data policy decision which the PCC rule refers to provided by the PCF and no preconfigured redirection address for this PCC rule at the SMF.
        - CM_END_USER_SER_DENIED: Indicate that the charging system denied the service request due to service restrictions (e.g. terminate rating group) or limitations related to the end-user, for example the end-user's account could not cover the requested service.
        - CM_CREDIT_CON_NOT_APP: Indicate that the charging system determined that the service can be granted to the end user but no further credit control is needed for the service (e.g. service is free of charge or is treated for offline charging).

        - REF_ID_COLLISION: Indicates that PCC rule could not be successfully installed/modified because the same Policy Decision is referenced by a session rule (e.g. the session rule and the PCC rule refer to the same Usage Monitoring decision data).
        - TRAFFIC_STEERING_ERROR: Indicates that enforcement of the steering of traffic to the N6-LAN or 5G-LAN failed; or the dynamic PCC rule could not be successfully installed or modified at the NF service consumer because there are invalid traffic steering policy identifier(s) within the provided Traffic Control Data policy decision to which the PCC rule refers.
        - DNAI_STEERING_ERROR: Indicates that the enforcement of the steering of traffic to the indicated DNAI failed; or the dynamic PCC rule could not be successfully installed or modified at the NF service consumer because there is invalid route information for a DNAI(s) (e.g. routing profile id is not configured) within the provided Traffic Control Data policy decision to which the PCC rule refers.
        - AN_GW_FAILED: This value is used to indicate that the AN-Gateway has failed and that the PCF should refrain from sending policy decisions to the SMF until it is informed that the S-GW has been recovered.
